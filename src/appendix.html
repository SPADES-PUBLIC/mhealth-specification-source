        <h2 id="gzip-usage-decision">Using text formats with Gzip compression</h2>
        <p>One concern some have raised with saving data in a text (ASCII) format instead of binary is that text is
          not an efficient use of disk space, and that the I/O processing of the text files will dramatically slow
          down software using the data. Each concern is discussed below.</p>
        <h2 id="efficient-use-of-disk-space">Efficient use of disk space</h2>
        <p>The mHealth format saves all data in text (ASCII) files and then calls for compressing those files using
          gzip compression. Some tests were therefore performed to verify that saving high sampling rate CSV
          text data and then compressing the resulting file was both efficient in terms of storage and efficient in
          terms of computation required.</p>
        <p>Best-and worst-case csv files with high resolution 3axis
          accelerometer data were generated to assess
          the impact on compression. For the bestcase
          scenario, the csv contained 1 hour of 50 Hz data with a
          full readable timestamp per row and floating point g values that are not changing (mimicking sedentary
          behavior). <strong>Below are 10 rows from that file:</strong></p>

        <p>The resulting CSV file is approximately 7.9MB for a full hour, and when gzipped it compresses to
          499KB, a 94% compression ratio. [Add how long it takes on a phone to do the compression]</p>
        <p>For the worstcase
          scenario, a second csv file with 1 hour of 50 Hz data with a full readable timestamp
          per row and floating point g values that are randomly changing over a 6 g range was generated. <strong>Below are 10 rows from the file:</strong></p>

        <p>The resulting CSV file is approximately 7.8 MB for a full hour. Notice that it has approximately the same
          size as the previous case because both files have approximately the same number of characters.
          Gzipping the file reduces it to 2.0MB, a 74% compression ratio.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the same tests were performed where the data were saved in binary format. For the
          bestcase scenario, the resulting binary file is approximately 7.0MB for a full hour, and when gzipped it
          compressed to 486KB with a 93% compression ratio. For the worstcase scenario, the resulting binary file is approximately 7.0MB for a full hour, and when gzipped it compressed to 2.3MB with a 67% compression ratio. Note that for both tests, the resulting binary files have an identical filesize, which is
          expected due to the fact that all floating point numbers (accelerometer x,y,z) are stored as bytes (4
          bytes each, 12 bytes total).</p>
        <p>Comparing the two versions of the second test (CSV vs binary, randomized data points), we can
          conclude that the CSV format yielded a smaller file size after gzipped (2.0MB vs 2.3MB, respectively).
          This is expected, due to the fact that CSV files can be gzipped more efficiently because in the average
          case of an accelerometer data file, the first 23
          characters (including the minus sign for negative
          numbers) of the floating point values are largely repeated across the file. In the case of the binary data
          file, all floating point values are always stored as 4 bytes which have to be preserved by the gzip
          compression, resulting in a less efficient compression rate.</p>
        <p>Realistically, accelerometer values do not change randomly and dramatically on all axes as shown in
          the previous example. There are physical limitations to movement and people spend considerable time
          sedentary. Therefore, it is likely that the average data file size for an hour of accelerometer data
          collected from a wearable sensor will be in the middle of the range between 500K and 2.0MB (i.e.
          around 1.2MB). In addition, the inclusion of a full timestamp per row has minimal impact because most
          of the characters are repeated in every row and therefore gzip compresses the timestamp efficiently.
          Indeed, compressed Actigraph data from real users (without timestamps) led to csv.gz files of about
          700KB per hour.</p>

        <p>* Large gaps occur in the data for GT3X file format version 2. When converting to csv (mHealth or
          otherwise), Actigraph’s guide instructs developers to fill in these gaps using the last known data point,
          causing the resulting mHealth file to be larger than the compressed gt3x version, depending on how
          large and frequent the gaps are within the gt3x file. For files spanning over longer ranges of time, the
          size difference may become more apparent given that Actigraph leaves gaps in the data empty. For the
          two marked data points, without filling the gaps, the mHealth file sizes are 66.3 MB (csv is 409.2 MB,
          compressed differentials is 39.6 MB, ~60% total gap in the data) and 88.1 MB (csv is 473.9 MB,
          compressed differentials is 48.7 MB, ~55% total gap in the data) respectively.</p>
        <p>** Output from gt3xtomhealth
          converter was not split into separate hourly files for comparison sake.</p>
        <p>*** For an hour’s worth of data sampled at 30Hz where the person wearing the accelerometer is
          sedentary, compressed differentials can yield an output as low as 316.4 kB (eg. 3rd row in the table),
          where each data point is 3 bytes except the first line, which has the full timestamp and data (to serve as
          a reference point).</p>
