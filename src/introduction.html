        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2 id="description">mHealth Format for Storing Annotated Physical Activity Data</h2>
        <p>This document describes a data format (referred to as “mHealth Format”) for storing annotated physical
          activity data, in particular when the data consists of raw accelerometer signals and other low and high
          sampling rate sensors. Annotated data are data that are labeled with start/end times for various
          activities, states, or contexts.</p>
        <h5 class="gray">The mHealth Format is intended to be:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>compact,</li>
          <li>flexible/extensible so that new data types can be added as needed,</li>
          <li>easy to understand,</li>
          <li>easy to manage and share for research purposes,</li>
          <li>easy to break into subsets of data or recombine (e.g., by day or hour),</li>
          <li>conducive to storing data collected in both short lab sessions and over many days, weeks, or
            months,</li>
          <li>decipherable by people by visual inspection without special software (for lowsampling
            rate data),</li>
          <li>machine interpretable,</li>
          <li>conducive to use for data saving on mobile phones,</li>
          <li>not impacted by changes in daylight savings time or changes of clocks on mobile devices, so
            there is not a fear of loss of data, and</li>
          <li>appropriate for storage on a distributed file system to enhance data accessibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The format is sufficiently extensible to handle a variety of new sensors that may permit multiday
          continuous data collection, variable sampling rates, variable sensitivity levels, multimodal
          data collection, and acquisition of other useful information about data quality.</p>
        <p>This format is intended to be used in projects where data are collected on people measuring their
          movement, behaviors, physiological state, and/or context. These data can be collected from multiple
          sensors and sensor types, including commercial wearable monitors, custom wearable monitors, and
          phones.</p>
        <p>The goal of this dataset format is to permit easy sharing of data for research purposes. For this reason,
          data are stored as simply as possible, but with all information that might be needed for researchers who
          did not collect the data themselves to use it in new projects. Moreover, we want as much of the dataset
          to be both human and machine interpretable, so that software can be built to easily manipulate and
          visualize the data. To make this possible, in addition to raw data collected from sensors, the dataset
          must contain wellorganized metainformation about the data. The metainformation
          should include information such as sensor operating characteristics, but also information about how the sensors were
          worn on the body or placed in the environment. Typically while the sensors are being worn,
          observational data are also collected, which may include information about the type, intensity, duration,
          and/or location of physical activity, as well as the contexts in which the data are being collected.</p>
        <p>The format is expected to be used in studies where data are collected for many days or weeks,
          ultimately from hundreds or thousands of participants in single studies. Therefore, it is important that
          the data not only be in a format that is easy to understand but also in a format that allows efficient
          storage in a distributed file system. Further, the format should permit efficient manipulation of data
          using distributed computational operations (e.g., computing metadata from the raw data).</p>
        <p>This data format and the tools that use it are intended to simplify the sharing of such data with other
          researchers. When datasets are adequately formatted for reuse, researchers should be able to easily
          and automatically load large datasets into programs that perform batch analyses and make inferences
          about the activities performed. Visualization software should make it easier to inspect large datasets.</p>
        <h2 id="example-data">Example Data</h2>
        <p>Researchers may want to browse an example dataset collected from one individual before reading
          further, to get a sense for the files and data structure being proposed: [TO DO add link].</p>
