        <h1 id="format-design-decisions">Format Specification</h1>
        <h2>Format design decisions and explanation</h2>
        <h5 class="gray">To meet the needs mentioned above, the format has the following characteristics.</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>All sensor data (high and low sampling rate), including annotation and metadata, are stored in a computer in a human readable, commadelimited
            text (ASCII) format.</strong> The CSV (commaseparated values) text file format is human readable (via common spreadsheet and
            data analysis programs), is easily parsed by computer, and can be edited by hand if necessary. CSV files are particularly wellsuited
            for analysis by high throughput analytical platforms (such as MapReduce and Spark), and they can be easily imported into database systems (such as
            MySQL), statistical software (such as Matlab and R) and big data frameworks (such as Apache Hadoop) that are important for managing massive datasets (the type of data that will soon be generated from mobile devices).</li>
          <li><strong>All CSV files are compressed (using the commonly available and efficient gzip
            compression library) to preserve disk space.</strong> The downside to storing data in the CSV
            (commaseparated values) text format is that high sampling rate data may require substantial
            disk space, especially when the format of the data is known a priori and formatspecific,
            binary storage strategies might be used. Disk space concerns are addressed by gzipping all CSV files
            as they grow in size (<a href="appendix.html#gzip-usage-decision">see Appendix: Gzip Compression for a justification</a>). The computational
            overhead of gzipping CSV files with highresolution data are acceptable, even on mobile
            phones, when the files are limited to about an hour of high sampling rate data per file (e.g., from
            12 seconds of compression time per file).</li>
          <li><strong>All sensor data, regardless of original data format, is converted into the CSV format and
            synchronized with other sensor data.</strong> This conversion requires special software for each
            sensor type. As long as the native format used by the sensor to save the data is known,
            converters can be easily written to create timestamped CSV files for the mHealth format. For
            example, converters are necessary (and need to be provided) to read and convert data from
            common devices such as the Actigraph and ActivPAL into the format described here. The
            converters will generate one file per sensor, with timestamps that allow sensor synchronization
            across files.</li>
          <li><strong>All CSV files begin with a header line, labeling each column of data, to ensure the file is
            easily human interpretable </strong>. The first line in each CSV file is the commadelimited
            row containing keys for each column (e.g., HEADER_TIME_STAMP, AUC, ACTIVITY_COUNT,
            START_DT, STOP_DT, etc.). Some of the most common header names are standardized (see
            Table 2 below) to provide data type information to software, but researchers can add data type
            labels as needed. For all sensor, event, or feature data files, the first key/column in the header
            line is HEADER_TIME_STAMP (because sensor data files will always have timestamps), and
            for all other data files, the first key/column should start with “HEADER_[First column_name]”,
            which permits any code reading the files to determine if a line is a header or data line, and then
            to determine the column name if the line is a header line. <sup>1</sup></li>
          <li><strong>Metadata are saved in computerand humanreadable CSV files with standard names.<br>
            Metadata typically include:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Descriptions of sensor types, properties, and placements at the time of data
                collection.</strong> These files are also data files that include sufficient detail so that the protocol
                can be both understood and reproduced by others. For instance, in some cases, the
                locations where sensors are worn might change, and the files should allow for proper
                annotation of such sensor swapping. The format described in more detail below provides
                naming conventions that should be followed for common metadata
                types. (see <a href="data-metadata-files.html#sensor-data-files">sensor file</a> and 
                <a href="data-metadata-files.html#sensors-metadata-files">sensors file</a>)</li>
              <li><strong>Descriptions of each participant.</strong> These metadata files about each participant would
                include all special notes that might influence interpretation of the data for that particular
                participant’s data. E.g, dominant arm, anthropometrics that affect measurement (tilt
                angle of sensor on waist), and gait/motion inconsistencies due to musculoskeletal
                deficiencies that can affect measurement (e.g. limp, Parkinsons, injury). These notes
                should be easily understood by those not present during data collection. (<a href="data-metadata-files.html#subjects-metadata-files">see subject
                data file</a>)</li>
              <li><strong>Timestamped labels of the activities performed, contextinformation,
                and/or physiological states.</strong> The time synchronization will depend upon the nature of the data
                (e.g., for some datasets and sensors such as gait recognition, the labels will be
                synchronized with millisecond accuracy, for others synchronization within a few seconds
                may be sufficient. Examples of activities might be running, walking, and talking.
                Examples of contexts might be location or properties of location (e.g., distance to a
                park). Examples of physiological states might be heart rate or galvanic skin response.
                (see <a href="data-metadata-files.html#annotation-data-files">annotation data file</a> and 
                <a href="data-metadata-files.html#ontology-data-files">ontology data file</a>)
<p class="comment topline"><sup>1</sup>The header/data line distinction is important, because in some cases scripts may concatenate CSV files. Header
                  files from multiple CSV files (e.g., for different hour of data from the same data source) could therefore end up in the
                  same data file. To allow software to strip these lines, the lines should begin with “HEADER_”.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Selfreported data provided by the participant throughout the study (e.g.,
                Ecological Momentary Assessment).</strong> Answers to questions and other selfreported
                data are synchronized with all other data sources.</li>
              <li><strong>Notes on any special considerations about the data.</strong> These notes include special
                exceptions for particular subjects, descriptions of how various data sources were
                synchronized, or any other information not already specified in other files that might help
                others interpret the data. (<a href="data-metadata-files.html#sessions-metadata-file">See session data file</a>)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Data are saved in a directory structure that segregates data by year, month, day, and
            hour. </strong>The directory structure accomplishes several goals. It permits data for particular
            timeframes to be easily identified and isolated. It permits data collected at different timeframes
            to be easily merged. It logically breaks up large amounts of data into manageable, intuitive
            chunks. It prevents data from being overwritten (even when there is a time zone change or
            daylight savings time change). Finally, it creates a logical structure for saving data that spans
            multiple hours, days, or even months (permitting scripts that allow further dataset
            parsing/merging). The details of the directory format are described below.</li>
          <li><strong>Data files are stored with the start time of data saving included in the file name.</strong> This
            format, described in detail below, ensures that data conflicts are avoided and data will never be
            accidentally overwritten.</li>
          <li><strong>Data files should not contain data from more than one time zone. </strong>If the device (i.e. mobile
            phone) changes time zones, it should stop saving data to the current file and create a new file
            for the new time zone.</li>
          <li><strong>Time zone information (UTC offset) is encoded in filenames for easy access to the
            file/directory’s time zone information .</strong> UTC offset is the difference in hours and minutes from
            Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for a particular place and date. Within files, the timestamps
            are stored in local time. However, to ensure that time zone information (and especially daylight
            savings time shift information) is not lost and does not create data storage conflicts, UTC offset
            is stored in the filename structure.</li>
          <li><strong>All file and directory names are limited to alphanumeric characters.</strong> Filenames and
            directory names will contain alphanumeric and/or selected special characters (09, az or AZ, and “”). This prevents problems from displaying these filenames on the web or saving them in various file systems. Spaces should not be used. File naming uses CamelCase structure (e.g., “ O riginal R aw”). A dot is used in the filename but the format uses it as a separator, so it should
            not be added to the name.</li>
          <li><strong>Timestamps are in localtime
            format. </strong>There are two types of timestamps. Timestamps in file
            names are in local time with timezone information. Timestamps within files are in local time
            without timezone information (because that information can be gathered from the file name if
            needed).
            <ul>
              <li>Many files contain timestamp information using the following convention:
                [YYYY][
                MM][
                DD][
                hh][
                mm][
                ss][
                mmm][
                P/M][hhmm], where YYYY=year (4 digits),
                MM=month (2 digits [0112]),
                DD=day (2 digits [0131]),
                hh=hour (2 digits [0023]),
                mm=minute (2 digits [0059]),
                ss=second (2 digits [0059]),
                mmm=millisecond (3 digits
                [000999]),
                P=plus and M=minus and hhmm represents the hour and minutes of the
                offset of the time from GMT. The International Standard ISO 8601 is used to store all
                timerelated
                data. Example: 3:15 AM local time on January 1, 2000 for a timezone five
                hours behind GMT would be listed in the filename as
                “20000101031500000M0500”.</li>
              <li>Internal to files, the timestamp is listed in the same way but without the timezone
                information following this convention: [YYYY][
                MM][
                DD] [hh]:[mm]:[ss].[mmm]. Example:
                3:15 AM local time on January 1, 2000 would be listed in the timestamp column of a data
                file as “20000101
                03:15:00.000”. Timestamps should typically be the first column in a
                data file. The header for this column should be “HEADER_TIME_STAMP”. The
                timestamps always refer to the local time in the place where the data were saved.
                Timezone information can always be obtained by parsing the filename of the file storing
                the data.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Data in CSV files are formatted in the following way to minimize encoding problems:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Each record is one line</strong>, but fields may contain embedded linebreaks (see below) so that a record may span more than one line.</li>
              <li><strong>Fields are separated with commas.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Headers are all caps to help differentiate them from other data. </strong>Examples of header
                names are HEADER_TIME_STAMP and START_TIME and DATA_SAMPLE.</li>
              <li><strong>Variable names use alphanumeric characters and CamelCase.</strong> Examples of variable
                names are PhoneOn, Yes, No, 0, 1, and ButtonClicked.</li>
              <li><strong>All data entries that are text values with more than one word or special characters
                should be surrounded by doublequote
                characters.</strong> This is so that special characters,
                such as commas, can be handled and strings can be more than one word in length (e.g.
                “This is a sample text”). Oneword
                text values do not need to be surrounded by
                doublequote
                (e.g. male, female, High, Moderate, etc.). If the text value contains double
                quotes, the double quotes need to be properly escaped with a backslash (e.g. “The
                subject said, \”I did not feel well today \”, repeatedly”).</li>
              <li><strong>Fields with embedded commas must be delimited with doublequote
                characters. </strong>For example, a field with value New York, NY should be should be stored as “New York,
                NY” because the value has an embedded comma.</li>
              <li><strong>Fields that contain double quote characters must be surrounded by
                doublequotes,
                and the embedded double-quotes
                must each be represented by a
                pair of consecutive double quotes.</strong> For example<br>
                <i>The subject said “No”</i><br>
                should be stored as<br>
                <i>“The subject said ““No”””.</i></li>
              <li><strong>A field that contains embedded linebreaks
                must be surrounded by doublequotes.</strong> For example (this is a single field in a record),
                <pre>      
    John,
         Please bring the patient in.
         J.D.
should be stored as :
    “ John,
           Please bring the patient in.
           J.D. ”</pre>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Leading and trailing spacecharacters
                (i.e. spaces and tabs) adjacent to comma
                field separators and not in quotes are not allowed and will be ignored.</strong> (e.g.
                <pre>“Eating” , “Drinking”, “Walking”
is equivalent to
“Eating”,”Drinking”,”Walking”</pre>
                because the spaces will be removed)</li>
              <li><strong>Fields with leading or trailing spaces must be delimited with doublequote
                characters.</strong> (e.g. To preserve the spaces in the previous example, the record should be
                stored as: “Eating ”,“ Drinking”, “ Walking”)</li>
              <li><strong>Fields may always be delimited with double quotes.</strong> The delimiters will always be
                discarded.</li>
              <li><strong>The first record in a CSV file is a header record containing column (field) names,
                and the first header should start with “HEADER_[HEADER_NAME]”. </strong>(E.g.,
                “HEADER_FIRST_NAME”)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The remainder of this document describes the details of the format, which uses conventions for data
          files, file naming, and directory structure.</p>
        <h2 id="supported-sensor-types">Uniquely identifying sensors (SensorType)</h2>
        <p>The format assigns meaningful “SensorType” names to all sensors (e.g., “Wocket”,
          “ActigraphGT3XPlus”, “FitbitV3”) so that simply by looking at the file name, researchers can have a
          sense of what type of data will be in the file. Refer to Table 1 for some SensorType examples.
          Individual pieces of sensor hardware are uniquely identifiable by their SensorType combined with a
          “SensorID.” SensorIDs differentiate sensors of the same type using a unique identifier. For wireless
          sensors, the SensorID might be a MAC Address. For phone sensors, the SensorID might be the unique
          phone ID (e.g., IMEI). When such a unique number does not exist, GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers)
          generated by the user’s computer system are used to ensure uniqueness. They can be randomly
          generated. The SensorType name should be in CamelCase style.</p>

          <li><strong>[ParticipantID]</strong> . Contains all information related to a specific participant within that study.</li>
          <li><strong>OriginalRaw</strong> . Contains all the original raw files output during the study from various devices for
            a particular participant. Files in this directory should never be deleted to preserve the original,
            raw, untouched data.</li>
          <li><strong>MasterSynced</strong> . Contains the master copy of the original data, synchronized, in the mHealth
            format. Once the data have been cleaned and synchronized, any transformation done to these
            original data files should create new files in the appropriate unique subdirectory(s) in the
            Metadata directory.</li>
          <li><strong>Metadata</strong> . This directory contains metadata created when processing the MasterSynced data,
            broken into Metadata “TaskName” directories. These may include fully or partially transformed
            data or algorithm outputs that can be subsequently used as the source of data for later
            tasks/visualization and can be deleted or modified easily without any impact on the OriginalRaw
            data or the MasterSynced data. Each metadata task contains all information/data related to a
            specific analysis, algorithm, and/or transformation on a set of original data of a specific
            participant’s data. This analysis, algorithm, and/or transformation can be anything ranging from
            simple timeshifted
            transformations of the original data to creating sessionspecific
            data sets,
            which can then be transformed further. For example, a researcher may want to run an algorithm
            to find the average number of ambulatory steps a specific participant takes in an hour. In this
            case, a [MetadataTask] could be named “ AverageStepsPerHour ”. These “task” directories
            should maintain a directory structure identical to ParticipantID’s MasterSynced directory
            structure where the synchronized raw data is stored.</li>
          <li><strong>MetadataCrossParticipant</strong> . Contains all information/data related to any type of analysis,
            algorithm, and/or transformation done on multiple participants’ data. For example, a researcher
            may want to calculate the average number of steps taken in Day1, Day2, etc. for a particular
            study session. In this case, the “task” subdirectory could be named “ AverageStepsPerHour ”. In
            these directories, data are organized by day,
            month,
            and yearinstudy.</li>
          <li><strong>[YearNumber], [MonthNumber], [WeekNumber], [DayNumber]</strong> . These directories represent
            the number of year/month/week/day of a particular session of the study. For example, a
            researcher may want to run a crossparticipant
            session (named “Session1”) of a certain study
            (named “Study1”) for one week. The data files for this session should be stored in this directory
            structure: Study1/MetadataCrossParticipant/Session1/Year1/Month1/Week1/[Day1 Day7],
            where [Day1 Day7]
            represents 7 subdirectories under Week1 for each day in the session.
            Another example could be a session of a study being run on multiple participants for 3 years, in
            which case the data files should be stored in this directory structure:
            [StudyName]/MetadataCrossParticipant/[SessionName]/[Year1 Year3].</li>
